### Abstract 
<p align="justify">
One of the main ingredients to learn a visual representation of an object using the Convolutional Neural Networks is a large and carefully annotated dataset. Acquiring a dataset in a demanded scale is not a straightforward task;  therefore, the community attempts to solve this issue by creating noisy datasets gathered from web sources. In this paper, we studied the behavior of several deep architectures against a noisy dataset using the transfer learning method. In addition, we also proposed a novel approach of discarding the external noise of dataset using an unsupervised method called Isolation Forest. Based on our experiments, we achieved high recognition accuracies above 92 percent using two states of the art deep architectures on the noisy dataset, and we slightly improved the obtained results using the proposed noise reduction framework.
